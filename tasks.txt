- Split cat body into two parts so the chest is narrower and the hips wider.
- Front legs tilt inward so the paws are closer together.
- Front paws appear turned out with pads slightly outside the legs rather than being rotated.
- Add grey as a color option for the ears.
- Add a split green/blue eye color option (left eye green, right eye blue).
- Cat occasionally utters a brief 'meow!' in a word bubble.
- The 'meow' bubble appears in different spots around the head with a line
  connecting it to the cat.
- Top hat is taller with sides tapering toward the bottom and a thinner, wider brim.
- Front legs keep a constant width while tilting so their bottoms are closer than their tops.
