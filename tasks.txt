- Split cat body into two parts so the chest is narrower and the hips wider.
- Front legs tilt inward so the paws are closer together.
- Front paws rotate slightly outward from the legs.
- Add grey as a color option for the ears.
- Add a split green/blue eye color option (left eye green, right eye blue).
- Cat occasionally utters a brief 'meow!' in a word bubble.
