- Split cat body into two parts so the chest is narrower and the hips wider.
- Front legs tilt inward so the paws are closer together.
- Front paws appear turned out with pads slightly outside the legs rather than being rotated.
- Add grey as a color option for the ears.
- Add a split green/blue eye color option (left eye green, right eye blue).
- Cat occasionally utters a brief 'meow!' in a word bubble.
- The 'meow' bubble appears in different spots around the head with a line
  connecting it to the cat.
- Top hat is taller with sides tapering toward the bottom and a thinner, wider brim.
- Front legs keep a constant width while tilting so their bottoms are closer than their tops.
- The meow bubble stays mostly to the sides of the head and its connector line attaches to the mouth.
- Add a reddish eye color option styled for albino cats.
- Add black as a selectable paws color.
- Cat intermittently animates: ear twitch, whisker twitch, tail flick, blinking and looking eyes, and a paw whack with a "WHACK!" effect.
- Paw whack animation lasts longer with a three-stage motion, the paw enlarges as it swings, and the WHACK text appears over a yellow starburst.
- Current color selections are clearly highlighted in the character creator.
- Add black as a selectable muzzle color.
- Users can save multiple named cats. A list of saved names with mini portraits
  appears left of the cat during editing. Clicking a name loads that cat. The
  name field under the cat with a save button updates or adds a saved entry.
- Saving with a new name adds a new entry instead of overwriting the current cat.
- The list of saved cats is positioned slightly further left.
- The Done button is now labeled "Back" and sits in the upper left corner.
