Each task must respect the requirements of all prior tasks. This requires that these requirements are explicitly recorded so that they can be read and accounted for during future tasks. Each task may also permanently supersede (override/change) the requirements from prior tasks.

As such, upon completing each task you must:
- Add the requirements of the task to tasks.txt.
- Ensure that each code change is self-documenting, with variable/function naming and comments that make the requirements of the corresponding task clear to anyone reading this code in the future.
- Ensure that previous requirements are updated if they would otherwise contradict the requirements of the current task.
